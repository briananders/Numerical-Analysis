you'll see that on my last graph, I have graphed the error points. They seem to form two 
really nice curves. One has all the odd i's and one has all the even i's.
before 5, odd i's have less error, and after 5, evens i's have less error.
also, 8 has the lowest error. on either side the error goes up. on the higher end (i, from 15 on),
the error goes up a LOT more. the even i's are quite a bit lower than the odds, but they are still high.
